# Project Title: Body Mass Index from Face Images
### Technologies: Deep Computer Vision
### Domain: Healthcare

## Problem Statement:
Building a model to predict the BMI (body mass index) of a person from an image of their
face. This project borrows from another project made to classify the age and gender of
a person using the input of their face, including the weights of a trained model and a
script used to dynamically detect a userâ€™s face with their webcam. In addition to being
an interesting machine learning problem, predicting BMI in this way could be a useful
tool in medical diagnostics.

### The main objective here is -
1. Building a model to predict the BMI (body mass index) of a person from an image of their
face.
2. Face Detection is also required.
3. Maintaining a database to store each and every data.
   
### USE As Marketing Strategy
Gyms, Fitness Trainers and Fitness Apps can use this as their marketing strategy. On Social Media Platforms, they can prompt the potential customers to check their BMI by just uploading their image and if the BMI is not in the healthy range, they can alert the customer about the problems they might have to face due to excess weight and tell them to join their Gym or take their app subscription so that they can live a healthy lifestyle!

## HOW TO RUN THE WEB APP
Just run all the cells of Body-Mass-Index-from-Face-Images.ipynb. This will make your back end ready and also links it to the front end web app hosted on anvil. Web App Link : https://facetobmi.anvil.app/
